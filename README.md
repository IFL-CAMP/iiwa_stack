## IIWA STACK
ROS Indigo/Kinetic metapackage for the KUKA LBR IIWA R800/R820 (7/14 Kg).

**Current version : v-1.2.0 for Sunrise 1.11**    
[Using a previous version of Sunrise?](https://github.com/SalvoVirga/iiwa_stack/wiki/FAQ#which-version-of-sunriseossunrise-workbench-is-supported)

### Features
- Native ROSJava nodes running on the robot as a Sunrise RoboticApplication: supports ROS parameters, topics, services, etc.
- Integration of KUKA's SmartServo motions:
  - joint position, joint velocity and cartesian position control via simple ROS messages. 
  - online configuration of JointImpedance, CartesianImpedance, DesiredForce and Sine(Force)Pattern via ROS service.
  - online configuration of joint velocity and acceleration via ROS service.
  - updates on the time left to reach the commanded destination via ROS service.
- The Sunrise tool to use can be selected via a ROS parameter.
- Gravity compensation by setting the appropriate JointImpedance values.
- NTP synchronization with a server running on the ROS master
- full MoveIt! integration
- Gazebo support
